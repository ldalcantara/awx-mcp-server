# Step 2: Validate syntax
validate playbook deploy_app.yml

# Step 3: Test locally (dry-run)
run playbook deploy_app.yml in check mode

# Step 4: Test locally (real)
run playbook deploy_app.yml locally

# Step 5: Push to git
push project changes with message "Add deploy_app playbook"

# Step 6: Sync AWX project
update AWX project 1 from SCM

# Step 7: Launch on AWX
launch job template 3
```

### Role Development Workflow
```
# Step 1: Scaffold
create role webserver

# Step 2: Test locally
run role webserver on localhost

# Step 3: Push & sync
push to git and then update AWX project 1

# Step 4: Run via AWX template
launch job template that uses the webserver role
```

### Register → Discover → Run → Push
```
# Register an existing project
register project "infra" at C:\Users\me\ansible-infra

# See what's in it
show project playbooks for infra

# Test a playbook
run site.yml from project infra in check mode

## Combined / Multi-Step Queries

These queries may trigger multiple tool calls:

```
# Overview workflow
show recent jobs and their status
list all failed jobs and show why they failed

# Deep dive into a specific job
show job 1 details, output, and events
get job 1 status and show the logs

# Template + Launch workflow
list templates and run the Deploy template
show templates, then launch template 1 with extra vars {"target": "prod"}

# Inventory management workflow
list inventories, then show hosts in inventory 1
create a host in inventory 1 and then launch template 3 limited to that host

# Project + Template workflow
update project 1 from SCM, then launch template 1
list projects and show templates for project 1
```

## Tips

1. **Use Agent mode** — Click the mode dropdown in Copilot Chat and select "Agent" (not "Ask" or "Edit")
2. **No prefix needed** — Just type your query directly, e.g., `show recent jobs`
3. **Be specific with IDs** — Include job/template/inventory IDs when referring to specific resources
4. **Filter results** — Use words like "failed", "running", "page 2", or "filtered by name" to narrow results
5. **Natural language works** — The MCP tools are designed to understand natural phrasing
